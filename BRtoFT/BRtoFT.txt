% BRtoFT.m
%
% imports neural (LFP) data from Blackrock NS6 data (decimated to 1000 Hz)
% then uses trldat structure imported using PARtoTRLDAT to align the Python
% log info on a trial by trial basis
%
% the resulting data structure uses Fieldtrip format to facilitate analysis

% this code requires ft_progress.m (or you can comment out any line with a
% function starting with 'ft_')
%
% Notes:
% python samples position/direction at ~83 Hz; eye data @240
% timestamp values in panda log are already in ms (1 kHz)
%
% use of NEV file isn't required to align the data, but is a helpful check
% to verify the alignment of the behavioral events between the Python and
% Blackrock logs
%
% CHANGE LOG:
% 4/25/15 MJJ - turned into a function; took out NEV and all related code
% (this was used to check alignment between reward events in the different
% signals; can check this after running)
% 4/26/15 MJJ - fixed eye data alignment, since there were quite a few
% instances where xcorr wasn't working on its own; the new way is slow and
% clunky but it seems to work.
